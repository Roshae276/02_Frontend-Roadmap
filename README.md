# 🛣️ Frontend Roadmap Project

Hey!  
This is a basic project I made to display a visual roadmap for learning frontend development. It’s built using only HTML and CSS. The idea was to keep it super clean and easy to understand for beginners like me who are just starting out.

## ✍️ Why I made this

I’m currently learning frontend development and I often get confused about what to learn next. So I thought of making a simple visual guide for myself — and maybe others too. This also helped me practice HTML structure and styling flowcharts in CSS.
